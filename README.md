# RAHAFSALMAN7-Mini-Project-Linked-Lists
This project involves implementing a martyrs' data structure using a sorted doubly circular linked list and two vectors. The data structure will organize information about martyrs based on locations, with vectors storing martyr records sorted by name and date. The data input for the project comes from a CSV file containing martyr information.
